This is my most annoying life that I have ever lived. I sulked my way throught the crowd making sure everyone saw how annoyed I was. What I hoped for to be a peaceful week before having to travel to the south again turned out to be an utter disaster. If it would have been my fault I would have gone gladly, instead I foresaw this and warned them and they did not take my warnings seriously and now I have to clean up everyones mess.
