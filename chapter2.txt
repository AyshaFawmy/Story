I looked below at shrieks of the vile creatures gasping for a breath of air. It was not the for the first time i sensed all hope deserting me as I looked at the chance to get my old life back get slimmer. With a sigh, like hundreds of times befores, i decided to get on with it and praying to go that this nightmare would be over before the new year begins. 
I made my way down slowly, praying that my shivering body is not swayed over the cliff be the strong winds ranging around me. My vision was obscurred and my only guide was the diminishing sounds of the maggot as they die unable to breathe.
