The air was strangely quiet. All I could hear was the sound of my breath as I navigated along the long windy roads amongst those magnificent oaks. In another time I would have been thrilled with the views that surrounded me, but now all I thought of was how to leave this ghastly place behind.
    As I got closer to the tent, I could hear some shuffling and whistling. I stopped in my track and held my breath. I tiptoed towards a tree and hid behind it intently watching ahead. I weighed my option and wondered if it was best to leave my belongings behind than face whatever was amongst my makeshift home. The woods have not been kind to me so far and I didnt know what kind of creature I had to face next.
